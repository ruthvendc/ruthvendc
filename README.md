# Hi, I’m David 👋

Senior IT professional specializing in **Linux-based data systems**, **Oracle performance engineering/administration**, and **reliable batch data pipelines** built with Apache Spark and Airflow.

I bring a systems-first mindset — comfortable owning workloads from the OS and database layer up through orchestration and data transformation.
